README CREATION IN PROGRESS

This is my first major project in C++! Coming from a C and Rust background, my code likely won't be up to modern C++ standards, but I'm refactoring where I can as I work through learncpp.com. Loving the language so far!

Progress has slowed as school ramps up, but I'm planning on locking in during winter break to get it ready to implement my first research paper, Professor Tessendorf's [Simulating Ocean Water](https://people.computing.clemson.edu/~jtessen/reports/papers_files/coursenotes2004.pdf). Stay tuned!
